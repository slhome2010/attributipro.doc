# FAQ

These are frequently asked questions.

<details>
  <summary>I reinstalled the license, followed all the instructions, but it's still the free version...!</summary>

Possible reasons:

- Incorrect domain name. `domain.ru` and `www.domain.ru` are considered different domains.
- License key corruption during input or saving. Spaces and line breaks are ignored and removed programmatically.
- Incorrect license storage location. The `attributico.key` file must be placed in the `/system/license/` directory.

<details>
  <summary>I'm interested in purchasing the module. Will it conflict with the DreamFilter module?</summary>

The module does not conflict with **DreamFilter**, **megaFilter**, or any other filter. It does not interact with the frontend or filters but only works with the database, organizing **Attributes**, which are later used by filters.

<details>
  <summary>I can only specify a test domain for now. Can I add more later?</summary>

Yes, you can update it at any time as long as the number of domains and their characteristics comply with the [license](/license/license-install.md) terms.

<details>
  <summary>The module stopped working. I migrated to a new hosting provider. Could this be the reason?</summary>

Try the following:

- Clear the store cache.
- Clear your browser cache and cookies.
- Refresh the modifiers.
- Reapply and save the settings.

<details>
  <summary>How do I merge attribute values?</summary>

The module does not support attribute value merging using Drag-and-Drop, context menus, or keyboard shortcuts.  
This is intentional to keep the module simple, and because the same result can be achieved through regular renaming of values.

In essence, merging values or templates is just batch renaming, and this feature is already implemented. Simply edit the **Value** or **Template**.

For more details, see the [Editing](/module-features/editing.md) section.

<details>
  <summary>What is the workflow after parsing?</summary>

The module does not enforce a specific workflow but provides functionality that simplifies manual work and tools for batch processing.

One such tool is [**Category Attributes**](/tools/category-attributes.md).

:::info
In the settings, set [**`Method`**](/settings/product.md) to **Add duty attributes only to empty ones**.  
For other settings, the result is self-explanatory.
:::

### Notation:

- `C` — Category
- `P` — Product
- `A` — Attribute
- `V` — Attribute Value
- `D` — Duty Template

For example, in category `C1`, there is a product `P1` with **Attribute** `A1`, which has **Value** `V1`.  
You added **Attribute** `A2` with **Value** `V2`, and after parsing, two more products `P2` and `P3` were added with their own **Attributes** and corresponding **Values**.

| ![Working with empty Duty Templates](/img/tutorial/attribute_category_1.svg) |
|:--:|
| *Diagram 1 – Working with empty Duty Templates* |

Our goal is to unify **Category Attributes**, meaning every product in category `C1` should have the same set of **Attributes**.  
We apply the **"Category Attributes"** tool.

:::warning
Some values remain empty because the module "does not know" what to fill in.  
For example, **Attribute** `A1` can have **Values** `V1` or `V4`. Which one should be selected?
:::

To resolve this ambiguity, **Duty Templates** are used. If they are filled, the tool will produce the following result:

| ![Working with filled Duty Templates](/img/tutorial/attribute_category_2.svg) |
|:--:|
| *Diagram 2 – Working with filled Duty Templates* |

Now all **Values** are populated.

<details>
  <summary>Can the module be modified to display attributes on the homepage below the product image?</summary>

No. This module is designed for the admin panel and does not interact with the frontend.  
Some features may be available in future advanced versions.  
For now, this request should be directed to the theme (design) developers.
