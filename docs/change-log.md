# What's New in This Version

The most important change is the modification of the licensing system. Now, the license key obtained upon request is stored along with the settings. This offers several advantages:

- No need to download and extract an additional archive;
- No need to upload and overwrite files on the server;
- The license key is no longer dependent on the PHP version or Ioncube.
