# Free Version

Until you obtain and apply a valid license key, the module operates in the free version mode. Essentially, it is the same module but with limited functionality. Visually, the free version is identical to the paid version, except for the **(free)** label displayed next to the module name in the header. For example:

**Attribut&co v3.3.3 (free)**.

The limitations of the free version apply to database modifications. You can perform any actions with **Attributes** or **Values**, just like in the paid module, but changes will not be saved. After reloading the page, everything will revert to its original state.

The free version is designed for evaluating the module's functionality, assessing usability when working with attributes, and verifying compatibility with your OpenCart store.

:::info
Some features remain fully functional in the free version, such as **drag-and-drop sorting** of **Groups** and **Attributes**.

:::tip
The free version **does not require** domain name registration.
